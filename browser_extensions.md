## Browser Extensions

A browser extension is a small piece of software that extends the functionality of the browser, or in some case it's there for purely aesthetic purposes.

A lot of popular browsers such as Google Chrome and Firefox have support for these extensions (or addons as they're called in firefox terminology). In fact, Google Chrome has over 100,000 extensions!

##### Why should I use them?
Extensions can make your life easier, from blocking ads and trackers to making your browser look gorgeous through custom themes, and some extensions are built just to enhance your productivity!

Note that these extensions don't work *everywhere*. In browser-controlled pages such as settings and the extensions/themes page, all extensions are disabled for security purposes. 

##### Some examples

**Ublock Origin**
Ublock Origin identifies as a "content blocker" that also blocks ads and trackers for you. If you're sick and tired of seeing ads and unnecessary popups wherever you go, then you're gonna love this extension!

**Dark Reader**
Are you a dark mode fan? Then this extension is just for you. Not only can it enable dark mode on *any* website, but it can also adjust brightness, font settings and change contrast & sepia filter

**Vimium**
This extension will only be useful if you know vim keybindings. As you may have guessed already, this extension allows you to use vim keybindings in the browser! Goodbye mouse, hello `hjkl`

##### Where can I find these extensions?
You can find extensions for chrome over on the chrome [web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore), and for firefox refer to this [site](https://addons.mozilla.org)

##### Security
Browser extensions generally have access to sensitive data like your history, the ability to manipulate the look of your browser and to alter website content, so always be wary while installing them, only install extensions that are well-known and trusted.
A lot of the times, the browser web store will have a warning that the extension in question is not actively monitored and may not be safe.

Happy debugging,
