# GitHub

GitHub is a website which allows software developers to upload the source code for their projects, and practice version controlling using Git.
It is currently the biggest collection of source code, with over 190 million repositories (both public and private) as of Jan 2020.

## Features
Apart from providing a version control system, GitHub does a lot more:
- It allows developers to collaborate on their projects.
- You can make **pull requests** (pr) to contribute to other's projects.
- You can **fork** other people's project, and do independent development on it.
- It provides various features to manage projects, such as bug tracking, issues, task management through gitHub projects, wikis, etc.

## Plans
While gitHub offers it's basic services free of charge, it does have paid plans for more advanced features.

**Free** -> With the free plan you can make any number of public/private repositories. You get 500mb of package storage.

**Team** -> The team plan offers 2GB of package storage. You also get access to features such as draft pull requests, protected branches, and more.

**Enterprise** -> The enterprise plan offers 50gb of package support, and gives access to features such as GitHub connect, advanced auditing, automatic security, version updates, and more.

## Social Features
GitHub allows you to follow other people, and also star their projects, as a sign of appreciation for their project. Your number of followers and the people you follow is visbile on your profile's home page.

## Gists
While GitHub itself is for storing medium-to-large projects with multiple files and/or folders, GitHub also offers **Gists** which is used for storing code snippets, i.e, one file, these can be useful if for example you want to share a small script you made for automating a minor task.

## Alternatives
While GitHub is the most popular place for uploading open source projects, some alternatives do exist, such as Gitlab, Gitea, Bitbucket, Git Kraken, etc.
