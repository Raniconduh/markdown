# User Interface

### Introduction
A User Interface (UI) is what allows us to **interact with a program**. For example, if you open a web browser, you can see the tab bar on the top, which you can use to open or close tab. If the browser didn't have a UI, we would not be able to do this.

The user interface is the visible part of the program, what we see and interact with, but there are other things that may happen in the background which we may not see, such as adding data into a database.

There are three main types of user interfaces out there, let's check them out one by one.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
In a graphical user interface, we have a bunch of graphical elements throughout the screen such as buttons and text fields which we can interact with. This is the most common form of UI you will find nowadays. In fact, for many people, this is the *only* form of UI they've ever used.

A lot of common apps we use everyday, like the Windows File Manager, VLC Media Player, Chrome/Firefox, games such as Need For Speed or Call of Duty, all of them are GUI programs.

GUIs actually came into existence a while later than the other interfaces we will discuss. They were made due to the perceived difficulty of command line interfaces.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
A command line interface is one of the simplest interfaces out there, simple in the sense that it is easy to implement, but a lot of people think it's difficult. 
So basically, in a CLI you write a command, and the program executes it, that's it. No buttons, text fields/forms, or anything like that.

The best example of a CLI would be the terminal. If you tell a normal person that you use the terminal, they will think you're some sort of hacker. This is the stigma around CLI, since it's so different from GUI, which everyone is used to.

This will probably be the interface your programs have when you first start making them, since it's implementation is relatively much simpler than other forms of UI.

While you may think that CLIs are useless, you'll actually be surprised to know that there are certain advantages to using them. For example, using a CLI is generally faster than using a GUI, since you don't have to use your mouse to move around the screen and click on buttons, writing a quick command and hitting enter can be quick in several cases, if you're used to it of course.
This is one of the many reasons why some techy people prefer using the terminal.

### Text-based User Interface (TUI)
Text-based user interface is one of the lesser known user interfaces, much more so than CLIs. They both are actually a bit similar, hence a lot of people confuse between them and use the terms synonymously. 

A TUI may use the entire screen area and may accept mouse input. It can also use colors and special characters to make a box-like structure. You may also have button-like boxes which you can select.
While you may think that a TUI is quite similar to GUI, there's actually a distinct difference between them, a TUI runs inside a terminal, while a GUI uses it's own separate window.
You can think of a TUI as the middle ground between GUI and CLI.
Examples of TUI are lesser known, some of them are listed here for reference :- 
- Vim, Nano (text editors)
- Ranger (File Manager)
- Cmus (Music Player)
