# Open Source

Ever come across the term "open source" or "free and open source (foss)"? Source code is called open source when it is made available for public view and also allows anyone to modify and redistribute it.

### Advantages

**Transparency** -> Because you can view the source code of the program you're using, you can make sure that it's not doing anything behind the scenes which you don't want it to. For example, collecting your personal data.

**Experience** -> Students and programming enthusiasts can check out the source code and find issues with it that they can then report. To take this one step further, they can issue pull requests which fixes the issue. All this gives them experience with working with real-world software.

**Security** -> Since far more people can view the source code, the probability that they find vulnerabilities with the code also significantly increases.

### Proprietary Software

This type of software is in contrast to something known as "proprietary software" - in which the source code is only available to the developer(s) of the software.

### Free software vs Open Source software

While both of them mean roughly the same thing, they're meant in a different context:

- Free Software is meant in the context that users are free to do whatever they want with the software
- Open source software is meant in the context that it promotes collaboration amongst developers.

### Free as in freedom

There is a common misconception that the free in "free & open source" stands for financial freedom, i.e, it's free of cost. This is not true. Developers can charge money for open source projects.

The free actually means free as in freedom, people are free to view, audit, modify, redistribute the source code.

While developers can charge money for their open source project, some programmers find it more viable to keep it free and charge for *software support* instead. This includes help in installation, fixing issues, etc.

### Open Source licenses

Developers generally choose a license to go with their project to set some guidelines for the use of the code. There are several open source licenses out there, each providing a varying degree of freedom to the end user:

- GPLv3 (GNU's General Public License) is one of the most restrictive licenses out there. It states that the source code must be made public whenever a distribution of the software is made. It also says that the modifications must be released under the same license. Then there are some patent guidelines.
- BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) is more flexible than GPL. It states that the source code need not be made public when a distribution is made. Modifications can be released under any license, the license and copyright notice has to be included in the documentation of the compiled version of the source code. And you can't use the name of the author/developer for promotion.
- MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) is one of the most flexible licenses. It states that the source code need not be made public, modifications can be released under any license, no explicit statement on patent usage, and changes made to the source code may not be documented.

Interestingly enough, MIT is the most popular license.
