## Browsers and Search Engines

**Disclaimer ->** All the data related to market share and features is relevant as of the time of writing this article, 2021. This data may change in the future.

Many people don't actually know the difference between a web browser and a search engine, while in fact, they are very different things. Let's take a look at them one by one:

### Web Browser

##### Definition
A web browser (or simply, browser) is a program you use to access the internet. When a user wants to see a website, the browser fetches the page and displays it on the user's computer.

##### Features
Most modern web browsers provide facilities such as multiple tabs for simultaneous web browsing, A built-in password manager so that you don't have to remember all your accounts' login info, and a homepage with links to websites you commonly visit.

##### Extensions
Many web browsers such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox also allow you to install custom **extensions** (or addons, as they are called in firefox) which can enhance the functionality of the browser. You can find some common ones [here](extensions.md).

#### Market
As of today, Google Chrome is by far the most popular web browser out there. It holds roughly 70% of the market usage, whereas browsers like Firefox have less than 10%.

#### Examples
Some examples of web browsers are:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Brave
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari
- Opera

### Search Engine

##### Definition
A search engine is a system that performs searches on the world wide web to fetch relevant information based on a "search query". For examplewhen you search for "turtles" on google, it searches through the world wide web for articles/images/videos which are related to turtles.

##### Features
Modern search engines provide features like autosuggestions when you're writing the search query, filtering the results in different tabs such as: All, Images, Videos, etc. Some search engines like DuckDuckGo have a very powerful feature known as a **bang**, what it essentially allows you to do is make a search *inside* a website through the search engine itself. For example, doing `!yt turtle` will automatically open youtube and give you vidoes related to turtles. **Note that Google doesn't have this feature**

##### Market
Just like with browsers, Google takes the reign in market share here as well, more so than in the browser market. Google holds roughly 92% of the market share, while the next contender, Bing, has barely 2.4%.

##### Examples
Some examples of search engines are:
- DuckDuckGo
- Google
- Bing
- Ecosia

### Difference between a browser and a search engine

A browser is what allows you to view web pages on your computerwhereas a search engine is what *actually* searches the world wide web to fetch relevant websites.

#### Why people seem to confuse between them
Most if not all browsers today set a default search engine for you (in most cases, Google), so people tend to not realize that they are actually two different things.

#### Another important point to note
Google Chrome is a web browser, while Google (not referring to the company) is a search engine, it is possible to use a different search engine with google chrome and vice versa.
