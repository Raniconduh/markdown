# What is an API?
Connectivity is an amazing thing, in today's world we all are used to it, nowadays we can purchase, post, pin, and pick anything just in a fraction of seconds. Ever thought about how does it happen? Well, Application Programming Interface, commonly know as API, is the unsung hero for it.

Think of API as a messenger that takes your request from the frontend (the user-accessible part of a program) and tells the backend (the server-side of a program) what you want and returns with your response.

Let's take an example of a restaurant, you (frontend) tells the waiter your order (request) and the waiter then goes to the kitchen to tell the chef (backend) what you need, and then he comes back with your food (response). Here, the waiter works as an API between you and the kitchen.

But let's make you familiar with a real-life example of an API. You must be familiar with weather forecast data you usually see on your phone, how does it happen? Your phone requests the API to fetch the forecast data with certain parameters like your location and time and then the API proceeds to the backend and tells the backend to filter the results of the forecast in terms of the location and time, the backend then further proceeds by giving the API the data of forecast with the specified parameters and then the API comes back with the response data which shows up on your screen.

So now you know that it's the APIs that make connectivity possible between all applications, databases, and devices, they all have APIs to make them operational. And that's what ultimately creates connectivity.

So whenever you think of an API, think of it as a waiter that runs back and forth between applications, databases, and devices to deliver the data and creates connectivity that puts the world at our fingertips.
