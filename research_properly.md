# How to research properly

## Schedule your research
Every time you have to research, make sure you allocate enough time for it. Write up a schedule with a series of milestones to accomplish by a specific date and time.
For example:
    `Finish researching about HTTP requests before 6 pm tomorrow`
    `Start researching about Machine Learning at 8 pm tonight`
Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RRQzAbC7ro) about how a programmer manages his time


## Deal with it piece by piece
This is related to 'Think like a programmer', but researching a large topic as a whole might get overwhelming.
So deal with the topic piece by piece.


## Use your resources efficiently and ask for help.
There are a lot of resources that exist which can help you with your programming research. I would tell you to **never stop** with Wikipedia, but rather start with it.

### Google and DuckDuckGo
Don't be guilty to use google, duckduckgo, or whatever search engine you like for your research.
I have seen a lot of people feeling guilty to search things up for no reason, so I just tell you not to be guilty and search up whatever you want.

### Stackoverflow
[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a pretty hyped forum between developers, and it will be pretty helpful too. I recommend you to **ask and answer** on StackOverflow **if** your question is not in the huge forum already and to search for questions properly without being vague.

For example:
    don't search for `Variable error in python` but rather for the real error like `Variable not defined error in python`

Answering questions can improve your reputation. Besides, helping others with their stuff is what it's for!

Visiting libraries might help too, even if you think it might not, just because it doesn't sound techy.


## Carry an idea notebook with you
Ideas don't always pop up while you are working on them, so try carrying a notebook and a pen/pencil with you so you can write down whatever idea you get in your mind in your free time. Trust me, this one is going to be the most helpful tip!
I also suggest watching some videos from [Thomas Frank](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG-KntY7aVnIGXYEBQvmBAQ) if you wanna stay productive and want to be filled with tips.


## Do additional research as necessary
Once you start writing down your research, you might find that there are lots of gaps in the paper. At this point, you might have to do additional research. It also helps expand your knowledge and possibly make your project better!

Anyways, beware of the trap of procrastination masquerading as productivity! Only do as much additional research as you need to answer your question. Donâ€™t get pulled into rabbit holes or dragged off on tangents. Get in there, do your research, and get back to writing. I also suggest keeping a separate document or piece of paper nearby to note points that need additional research.

**Now research with confidence!**


Happy researching,
