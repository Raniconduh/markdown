# IDE vs Text Editor 
A lot of the times we get confused between an IDE and a text editor, but it's good to have a proper understanding of them and what the differences between them are. Nowadays the boundary line between IDEs and Text Editors is increasingly getting blurred. There are text editors which have tons of features making it seem like an IDE but it's not. Let's start with the basic definition of IDE and text editor.

An IDE which stands for Integrated Development Environment, is a software application that provides several facilities to programmers for software development. As the name says, it is an application which provides you a development environment with several tools integrated in it.
An IDE generally includes :
- A text editor
- a code auto-complete function
- a debugging tool
- a compiler and an interpreter, and much more
Nowadays, many IDEs also consist of a *classic browser*, an *object browser* and a *class hierarchy diagram* for use in OOP i.e. object-oriented programming.

A text editor just allows you to write texts but an IDE does more than that. Let's take a common example for a more clear understanding. We all have used Notepad at some point in our life or at least heard about it. Now Notepad just allows you to write and modify text. But you cannot do anything more than that. Whereas if you take an IDE, you will clearly see a lot of difference, it will allow you to write, debug, compile, manage files and workspaces etc. But there are some text editors that are aimed for programming, such as sublime text, atom and vs code, which do provide some of the features of an IDE, such as intellisense, file management and workspace management

Now, many of you may ask that VSC also does all the things that an IDE does, so is it an IDE too? Well no. We will soon look into it but before that let's take a look at some of the most prominent IDEs : Microsoft Visual Studio (It's not VSC), NetBeans, PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse. 

Now coming to the question, is VSC an IDE? 
No it's not but it is one of the best text editors out there and can also be called a low-end IDE. In an IDE all the features are integrated in a development environment but text editors like VSC are able to provide so much features mainly because of plugins. We are able to carry out many tasks using VSC and other similar text editors because of plugins however it is not a complete environment with everything that a full scale IDE provides out of the box.

Now let us discuss about some of the best text editors which you can use to improve your workflow. 
- VSC : It is a text editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and MacOS, it includes tools for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
- Vim : It is a powerful text editor which runs in a terminal i.e. its interface is not based on menus or icons. Its GUI mode, **gVim** adds menus and toolbars for commonly used commands but the full functionality is still expressed through its command line mode. Vim has tons of keybindings to do everything, which makes the workflow very fast, but it simultaneously increases the learning curve.
